            <p>Hi there, as you already saw I am Brett. UX designer and backend developer for the web with a unique
                background. Before I became a designer and developer I worked in IT as a technician (2 years). That
                helped me develop communication and problem-solving skills that I find very useful.</p>
            <p>While I worked in my role as a technician, I discovered my passion for full stack development for the web
                and decided to pursue it as a career. I enrolled in an academy for web design and development to learn
                more about the field and develop my skills.</p>
            <p>In my free time, youâ€™ll probably find me on the tennis court.</p>
