                <p>Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as AI is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you,
                    here’s a handy roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable
                    research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own.</p>
                <img src="/assets/sensetime1.webp" />
                <p>This week in AI, I’d like to turn the spotlight on labeling and annotation startups — startups like
                    Scale AI, which is reportedly in talks to raise new funds at a $13 billion valuation. Labeling and
                    annotation platforms might not get the attention flashy new generative AI models like OpenAI’s Sora
                    do. But they’re essential. Without them, modern AI models arguably wouldn’t exist.</p>
                <p>The data on which many models train has to be labeled. Why? Labels, or tags, help the models
                    understand and interpret data during the training process. For example, labels to train an image
                    recognition model might take the form of markings around objects, “bounding boxes” or captions
                    referring to each person, place or object depicted in an image.</p>
                <p>The accuracy and quality of labels significantly impact the performance — and reliability — of the
                    trained models. And annotation is a vast undertaking, requiring thousands to millions of labels for
                    the larger and more sophisticated data sets in use.</p>
                <p>So you’d think data annotators would be treated well, paid living wages and given the same benefits
                    that the engineers building the models themselves enjoy. But often, the opposite is true — a product
                    of the brutal working conditions that many annotation and labeling startups foster.</p>
                <p>Companies with billions in the bank, like OpenAI, have relied on annotators in third-world countries paid
                        only a few dollars per hour. Some of these annotators are exposed to highly disturbing
                    content, like graphic imagery, yet aren’t given time off (as they’re usually contractors) or access
                    to mental health resources.</p>
                <p>An excellent piece in NY Mag peels back the
                    curtains on Scale AI in particular, which recruits annotators in countries as far-flung as Nairobi
                    and Kenya. Some of the tasks on Scale AI take labelers multiple eight-hour workdays — no breaks —
                    and pay as little as $10. And these workers are beholden to the whims of the platform. Annotators
                    sometimes go long stretches without receiving work, or they’re unceremoniously booted off Scale AI —
                    as happened to contractors in Thailand, Vietnam, Poland and Pakistan recently.</p>
