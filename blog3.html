              Instagram is developing ‘Blend,’ recommended Reels for you and a

            <p>
              Instagram is developing a “Blend” feature that creates a private
              feed of Reels recommended for you and a friend. The company told
              TechCrunch on Friday that the feature is an internal prototype and
              is not being tested externally.
            </p>
            <img src="instagram.webp" alt="Intsagram developing a blend feature." />
            <p>
              The feature was first spotted by reverse engineer
              Alessandro Paluzzi, who regularly discovers social media features in development
              ahead of their official launch. According to a screenshot posted
              on X by Paluzzi, a Blend would include “Reels recommendations
              based on Reels you’ve shared with each other and your Reels
              interests.”
            </p>
            <p>
              In other words, if you invited a friend to a “Blend,” Instagram
              would generate a personalized feed of Reels that it believes the
              two of you would be interested in. Blend appears to be somewhat
              similar to
              Spotify’s functionality of the same name, which launched in 2021 and allows two people to combine their
              favorite songs into one shared playlist.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The screenshot indicates that Blends would be private between you
              and the other user and that you would be able to leave a Blend at
              any time. Instagram didn’t share any specific details about the
              feature and whether Blends would continuously update with new
              recommendations or if they would be updated after a certain amount
              of time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The feature is designed to make it possible for users to discover
              new Reels together, which would be a way for Instagram to boost
              Reels’ discovery and watch time. Since people already send each
              other Reels via DMs, Instagram would now be using that data to
              proactively recommend and display Reels that it believes a pair of
              users would enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
              As with any other prototype, it’s unknown when or if Instagram
              plans to launch the feature externally.
            </p>
            <p>
              If released, Blend would give Instagram Reels users access to a
              fun and collaborative feature that isn’t available on its rival
              platform, TikTok. Though the two products are quite similar, the
              introduction of “Blend” could give Instagram a slight competitive
              edge over TikTok, albeit a small one considering TikTok continues
              to largely
              dominate the short-form video market.&nbsp;
