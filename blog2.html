                    <p>There’s not that much news from me this week, but I’ve been doing a ton of prep for TechCrunch
                        Early Stage taking place in Boston on April 25. It’s going to be a fantastic show, and you still have time to grab tickets
                            at early-bird prices, if you’re quick.</p>

                    <h2>Most interesting startup stories from the week</h2>
                    <p>Stability AI bids adieu to its founder and chief executive, Emad Mostaque, who’s decided to chase
                        the decentralized AI dream, leaving the unicorn startup without a permanent CEO. The company,
                        known for burning through cash faster than a teenager with their first debit card, is now in the
                        hands of interim co-CEOs Shan Shan Wong and Christian Laforte. Mostaque, in a dramatic exit,
                        took to X to proclaim his departure was all about fighting the “centralized AI”
                            bogeyman because, apparently, the real problem in AI isn’t rogue robots but who gets to
                        control them.</p>
                    
                    <p>Microsoft has orchestrated a heist worthy of a Hollywood plot, snagging the co-founders and much
                        of the staff of Inflection AI, along with the rights
                            to use their tech, for a cool $650 million. The deal, which to me seems more like a
                        ransom payment than an M&amp;A push, includes $620 million for the privilege of using
                        Inflection’s tech and an extra $30 million to ensure Inflection doesn’t sue for Microsoft’s bold
                        talent grab. Reid Hoffman, Microsoft board member and Inflection co-founder, took to LinkedIn to
                        assure everyone that Inflection’s investors would sleep well tonight, with early backers getting
                        a 1.5x return and later ones a modest 1.1x, despite the math not quite adding up. It’s pretty
                        bold to describe a 1.5x return as a “good upside,” by the way — most early-stage funds would be
                            pretty displeased.</p>
